### Aim : 
To design a PCB for CookTop and create an application which would enable us to operate our CookTop through phone.
### Introduction : 
Induction cooktops generate electromagnetic energy that interacts directly with compatible cookware, turning pots and pans into their own heat source. Because the heat doesn't have to transfer through the cooking surface, induction cooktops can provide fast cooking, optimal temperature control and easy cleaning due to the fact that the glass top surrounding the element stays cool.Cooking on an induction stovetop beats an electric stovetop for efficiency by about 40 percent.

### Procedure : 
Intially, we started with the basics of Electromagnetic Theory and learnt the principles used in Induction CookTop. The induction stove works on the principle of electromagnetism, which is a new thermal energy technique.When the high-frequency alternating current goes to the coil, it will generate a certain range of magnetic fields. This magnetic field range can generally reach the top of the glass-ceramic within 3cm height. The internal molecules of the bottom of the pot or pan rub intensely through the induction of the magnetic field so that the vessel itself generates thermal energy. It reduces the wastage of heat energy, thereby keeping the kitchen cool. As for the range of temperature, the induction cooker has a wide variation, and the boiling time is far lesser than that of the electric stove or the gas stove.

As all the things around us are being digitalized , we thought to connect our cooktop to our smartphones. So, we learnt about flutter and exchanged our ideas about the features which should be inculded in the app controlling the cooktop. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android , iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. While writing and debugging an application,flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine. This allows for fast compilation times as well as "hot reload", with which modifications to source files can be injected into a running application.


When we got familiarized with the project we had discussions on the requirements and constrution of PCB. The PCB was designed in EasyEda, a free open source platform. We proceeded further by documenting the decided circuit in EasyEda sheet. In the next step we made the circuit into a PCB in the same software.
